# Magic-The-Gathering-Tool
A tool that can check price, and store your cards (as well as other details) in a local DB

Goals:
- ~~Show a list of user-entered cards, with corresponding worth (individual as well as total) in USD~~
- ~~Store cards in a local DB (using MongoDB)~~
- ~~Give users the option to upload their card details into the cards collection~~
- Enable functionality to search cards by keyword (like in MTG Arena)
